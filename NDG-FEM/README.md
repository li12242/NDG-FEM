# NDG-FEM

NDG-FEM is an open source library based on Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Methods. The software contains multiply solvers for various problems, eg. one- and two-dimensional convection problems and shallow water equations with wet/dry problems.

## Features

The NDG-FEM is built with object-oriented concepts and the basic components, eg. the standard element and the computation mesh, is all written in classes. The standard elements
